Description
The Simple Calculator is a console-based application that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator, then returns the result.

Supported Operations
Addition: Adds two numbers.

Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.

Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.

Division: Divides the first number by the second (with error handling for division by zero).

Features
Simple text-based user interface.

Handles basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

Error handling for division by zero.

Clear and easy-to-read prompts.

Technologies Used
C++: The core programming language used for implementing the calculator.

G++: The compiler used for compiling the C++ code.

Installation
Follow these steps to get the Simple Calculator up and running on your local machine:

Clone the repository
First, clone the project to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/HuzeThat/simple-calculator-cpp.git
Navigate to the project directory
Open a terminal and go to the project folder:

bash
Copy
cd simple-calculator-cpp
Compile the C++ code
Make sure you have G++ installed on your system. Then, compile the C++ code with the following command:

bash
Copy
g++ -o calculator main.cpp
Run the program
Once the program is compiled, run it using the following command:

bash
Copy
./calculator
Usage
After running the program, it will prompt you to input the first number.

Then, it will ask you to select an operation: +, -, *, or /.

Next, it will prompt you to input the second number.

The result of the operation will be displayed.

You will be asked if you would like to perform another calculation or exit the program.

Example interaction:


Copy
Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter the second number: 5
Result: 15
Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): y
